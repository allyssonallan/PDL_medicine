# PDL medicine
Phenotype prediction using cancer-related data

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting phenotypes based on cancer-related data. It leverages various data science and machine learning techniques to analyze genetic and clinical data, aiming to identify patterns and correlations that can predict specific cancer phenotypes.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately determine cancer phenotypes from a given dataset. This involves:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning to prepare the dataset for analysis.
- Exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset's characteristics and underlying patterns.
- Feature selection and engineering to identify the most relevant features for the predictive model.
- Model development and training using suitable machine learning algorithms.
- Evaluation of the model's performance and fine-tuning to improve accuracy.

## Data
You can utilizes cancer-related datasets, which may include genetic sequences, clinical data, patient demographics, and other relevant information. Due to privacy concerns these datasets are not disclosed publicly.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data processing and model development.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development and documentation of the code.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning model development, training, and evaluation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## Installation and Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine, or use the `.ipynb` file directly in Google Colab.
2. Open the `PDL_for_medicina.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter to view the project's code and documentation.
3. Follow the instructions within the notebook to run the analysis and model training processes.

## Contact
For any queries or further information, please contact the project maintainer via Issues. This file was made when I was beginning to work with DL and medicine, at about 2021, using Google Colab.
